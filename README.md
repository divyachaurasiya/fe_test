# Frontend Test

##### *If you got here by accident, but want to apply for a frontend position anyway, feel free to fork the project and send [@mthines](https://github.com/mthines) the results.*

## ðŸŽ¯ The test

### Create a page that can be used to read different Posts.

- Using a Mock GraphQL endpoint, I should be able to see all of the available posts, and then select a specific post I want to read.
- Apollo and GraphQL codegen is already installed and setup, so you just need to run the generate function to get the queries you've written.
- All the colors needed are already defined as CSS Variables in the `styles` directory.
- The design is only a reference and feel free to improve it if you want.
- The task can be completed without adding any extra modules, but feel free to add any if as you see necessary.

#### Things to consider.
- Routing
- Design
- Caching
- Loader
- Typescript Typing
